## UI for the immiportal app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It uses Okta for authorization. I followed the developer docs to use the okta-react SDK - https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/before-you-begin/

To use reactJS and okta signon widget, use this guide - https://developer.okta.com/code/react/okta_react_sign-in_widget/
AFAIK you can integrate login with social identity providers quite easily with the sign in widget. Check out the branch react-signin-widget for this.
